Replication between data centers with JBoss Data Grid
=====================================================

Today's global businesses oftentimes have data centers in various
locations around the world.

The reason is the need to survive catastrophic site failures such as
earthquakes, floods, hurricanes (Sandy), or terrorist attacks (9/11),
and to store the data close to where it is needed.

To achieve this, data is replicated not only *within* a site, but also
*between* sites, hence the need for cross-site replication.

This is a challenge because links between sites are oftentimes
bandwidth constrained and have high latency.

In this session, we'll give an overview of Infinispan's cross site
replication functionality, which stores data redundantly across
multiple sites.

We'll briefly discuss architecture and configuration, and then focus
on two scenarios: site failure, where we'll kill a site, and
follow-the-sun, where we'll demonstrate a graceful failover from one
site to another.

In both cases, we'll see that clients fail over to another site while
the data is still available.

Attendees are encouraged to fire up their own clients, create some
data and verify that their data is preserved across site failures.

The take-away of this session is that attendees will understand what
cross-site clustering is, and how to configure and run it. We will
also discuss the plans we have for the future of xsite replication.
